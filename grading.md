## Homework

Homeworks will submitted via Github classroom in the form of a Jupyter notebook within a GitHub repository. All written work should be submitted in the repo README.md file using Markdown and Latex (see Markdown introduction [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and Latex introduction [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)). Accompanying data files such as Excel files and Aspen files should also be uploaded with the text file.

Please see instructions for installing Git [here](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-10-01-uw/). See a video tutorial for submitting homework assignments with Git here.

## Late Work

Late assignments will be penalized by 10% for the first 0-24 hours and 10% for each additional day (including weekends and holidays).

With the exception of pre-arrangement with the instructor in extenuating circumstances, **exams must be taken on the day scheduled**. No re-dos will be offered.

## Projects

Class projects will be completed in teams of 3 (with 1-2 teams of 4 if it doesn't split evenly). Teams will be assigned randomly. Each team will select a project from one of the following sources:

1. Appendix C of Turton
2. Additional projects found [here](https://richardturton.faculty.wvu.edu/projects)
3. Past problems from the [AIChE design competition](https://www.aiche.org/community/students/student-design-competition/past-problems)
