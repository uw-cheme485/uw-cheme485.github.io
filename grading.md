## Course Grade

Final grades are broken down as follows:

| **Item**           | **Points**    |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| Homework           | 15%           |
| Presentation       | 10%           |
| Exams              | 20% x 2 = 40% |
| Final Exam         | 35%           |
| **Total**          | 100%          |

## Homework

Homeworks will submitted via Github classroom in the form of a Jupyter notebook within a GitHub repository. Written work will be typed out in Markdown (see Markdown introduction [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) with equations formatted using Latex (see Latex introduction [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)). Numerical solutions will be completed using Python.

## Class Presentations

Students will give one presentation on the solution to a transient heat/mass transfer problem found in the provided [Conduction Heat Transfer Solutions](https://github.com/uw-cheme512/gradmath2019/blob/master/student_presentations/heat_transfer_solutions.pdf). Students can sign up for a presentation date [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kF6XKiX3tJOpuOQfxG4tSMkHaaxj6yw-UsPFIz7lbQo/edit?usp=sharing). The presentations must include:

1. A diagram of the specified problem.
2. A mathematical expression of the unsolved differential equation, with an explanation of each term.
3. An explanation of the expected behavior of the solution using the boundary conditions and initial conditions and stability theory
3. A step-by-step solution of the differential equation using analytical methods
4. A plot of the solution and an explanation of its behavior

Students can receive up to 5% extra credit by providing a numerical solution in addition to an analytical solution.

## A Note About Collaboration

Everything you submit in this class should be your own work. If you do need to "copy-paste" from the web or from other students' notebooks, this should be clearly cited. Using examples isn't entirely off-limits, but you learn by doing, not by copying. We will follow the [UW academic misconduct policy](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/academic-misconduct/) for any suspected instances of cheating on homework or exams. Any confirmed instances of cheating will result in a zero. Any 2nd instance of cheating will result in a zero for the entire course grade.

Oh, and please do not use solution manuals or pass around homeworks from former students. Have some self-respect.

## Late Work

Late assignments will be penalized by 10% for the first 0-24 hours and 10% for each additional day (including weekends and holidays).

With the exception of pre-arrangement with the instructor in extenuating circumstances, **exams must be taken on the day scheduled**. No re-dos will be offered.

## Exams

All exams are cumulative. Students will be allowed a copy of the cheatsheet printed on one page, with any additional notes they can fit on that page. **No textbooks will be allowed**. Calculators will not be necessary.
