# Textbook

The class follows Varma and Morbidelli's **Mathematical Methods in Chemical Engineering** (2005). An online version is available to students through the [University library system](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=CP71174540470001451&context=L&vid=UW&lang=en_US&search_scope=all&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,morbidelli%20chemical%20engineering). A topical breakdown is as follows:

1. Matrices and Their Application
2. First-Order Non-Linear Ordinary Differential Equations and Stability Theory
3. Theory of Linear Ordinary Differential Equations
4. Series Solutions and Special Functions
5. Fundamentals of Partial Differential Equations
6. First-Order Partial Differential Equations
7. Generalized Fourier Transform Methods for Linear Partial Differential Equations
8. LaPlace Transform
9. Perturbation Methods

A rough break-down of the quarter will be matrices and ODEs prior to the first exam, first- and second-order PDEs prior to the second exam, and LaPlace and perturbation methods for PDEs prior to the final exam.

# Additional Materials

A useful resource for several topics covered in the course are [Paul's Online Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx). They do **not** include all course material, so do not solely rely on them.
