## Planning Reports

# Requirements

- **Your written Planning Report (PR) must be submitted electronically as a Word doc to the designated instructor 4 days in advance of your experiment** (Thursdays for section AA, Fridays for section AB). If you would like to use an alternate format, please talk to the instructor prior to submission.

- The designated instructor will grade the PR, offering suggestions and corrections using track changes. The TA will inform the team via email one day prior to the lab period if they are ready to start the experiment or if a meeting is needed.

# Organization

- **File name**: Use the format "Labx_session_team_experiment_PR"
- **Title page**: Include the number and name of the experiment (e.g. Experiment 1, Pump Characterization), lab section and team (e.g. AA_A), and names of team members. Identify the PR Task Leader.
- **Introduction**:
  1. Summarize the relevant theory
  2. Include key equations and cite sources, but omit details such as derivations. Equations should be separate from the text and numbered.
  4. Include the purpose and scope. Objective must be specific. *The assignment memos are purposefully vague, so you must define more specific objectives.* Otherwise, you will not have a clear purpose for your experiments and analysis.
  5. Summarize results/data available in the literature (If you do not believe that no relevant data exist, say so and describe your search).
- **Materials and methods**:
  1. Describe available equipment and how you will use it to achieve your objectives.
  2. Include a schematic showing all key devices, controls, and instrumentation.
  3. Explain what data you will collect. Be as specific as possible. For example, give ranges over which variables will be adjusted, number of measurements at each condition, etc.
- **Discussion**:
  1. Explain how the data will be analyzed. You must include the sample calculations in the appendix.
  2. Give the literature and other information at your disposal, your expectations (trends, likely errors, etc).
  3. Comment on alternative approaches you considered, if any.
  4. Given the time available, will you be able to collect enough data to draw convincing conclusions?
- **Note safety issues** for this experiment (omit "obvious" issues such as sharp objects, electrical power, etc. unless you believe there is a specific safety issue). Briefly note possible hazards of chemicals used.
- **References**. This section compiles the literature cited (refer to the Final Report Guidelines for reference formatting).
- **Member contributions**. Clearly state the contribution of each member to the report.
- **Apendices**. Include sample calculations that show how you will analyze the data, including error analysis. Use an equation editor. Include all required unit conversions. Do your best to use realistic numerical values (a reasonable guess is OK).

# Grading

- The PR is graded out of 100 points; 60% goes to the Task Leader, and 20% goes to each other team member to incentivize teamwork. You will be allowed to use appropriate parts of the PR in the Final Report. Thus, the better the PR, the easier preparation of the Final Report will be. A sample grading sheet can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-S8k7XMPH9IsSfNsV_GFbLkdrAf6DEoi).

- Grading criteria are as follows:
  - Propose experiments that satisfy the assignment.
    - Experiments will provide the desired results.
    - Results will answer the assignment's questions sufficiently.
    - Alternative approaches are planned as appropriate (in case first approach fails).
  - Includes sufficient detail for a person "skilled in the art" to perform the proposed experiments.
    - Relevant equipment dimensions, key devices, controls, instrumentation, connectivity, limiting operating conditions, etc.
    - Proposed operating conditions.
    - Measurements: which, when, and how.
  - Describes expected results.
    - Shows examples of figures, tables, and equations expected for the Final Report.
    - Explains how experimental data might compare to predictions from theory or correlations.
  - Suggest safe procedures and include specific methods to maintain safe operation.

    - Clarity.
    - Professional tone.

## Final Reports

# Requirements

- **Your written Final Report (FR) must be submitted electronically as a Word file to the designated instructor by midnight on your normal meeting day during the week of oral presentations**. This means Mondays for Section AA and Tuesdays for Section AB.

# Audience

- Plan on writing for a technical manager who already understands the experimental objectives and fundamentals.

# Length

- What you believe is appropriate, but use common sense.

# What to Omit

- Do not include a letter of transmittal or a table of contents.

# Organization

- **File name**: Use the format "Labx_session_team_experiment_FR". For example, "Lab1_AA_B_PumpCharacteristics_FR". **Supplemental data**. Use the format "Labx_session_team_experiment_Data".
- **Title page**: This must be a separate page. Include a descriptive title (limit 10 words), author, lab section, team members, date, experiment number (1-3).
- **Introduction**: Describe the relevance of your work, the project objectives, and all the background material (theory) that will help the reader understand your system and objectives.
- **Materials and methods**: Describe the equipment, materials, and procedures you used. Provide one or more schematics (professional diagrams for the systems). Make your own diagrams, unless you are citing from a reference. The description must be sufficiently detailed to allow a knowledgeable person to reproduce your results. However, do not be excessive by including obvious details.
- **Results and discussion**: Present your major results (in the form of graphs and/or tables), including estimated uncertainties. Do not put lengthy data or results tables here (those are for the appendices). Use the appropriate number of significant figures. Interpret and analyze your results. Also send the data files (Excel spreadsheets, Jupyter notebooks, etc.) that you used for sample calculation. The following example notes trends but lacks sufficient interpretation:
  - "The data in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 show that for gases at low density, the viscosity increases with increasing temperature. For liquids, on the other hand, the viscosity usually decreases with increasing temperature."
  - A potential interpretation of the observed trends: "This difference in temperature dependence is understandable from a molecular viewpoint. In gases, the molecules are free and travel long distances between collisions to transfer momentum (hence the low viscosity). As temperature increases, the mean molecular speed of the gas increases. This in turn increases the frequency of gas collisions and therefore increases the momentum transfer or viscosity. In liquids, the molecules are not free but closely packed into a 'cage' which prevents them from easy motion. Hence liquids are more viscous than gases. As temperature increases, there is more energy for each molecule to escape this cage and move more freely. Thus, the viscosity of liquids decreases with increasing temperature."
  - Since the above is well-established, you could also say: "These trends agree with the standard molecular models of viscosity in gases and liquids [ref]." and provide an appropriate literature citation.
- **Conclusions**. Summarize your findings. Relate them to the objectives (as stated in your Introduction). Each conclusion must follow logically from information in the results and discussions sections.
- **Recommendations**. Recommend further actions, experiments, or improvements as needed. If desired, you may combine this sections with the Conclusions.
- **References**. This section lists all the literature cited in the report (including figures, equations, theory). For each citation, use the following convention, which is standard for the *AIChE Journal*:
  - For books:
    1. Bird, R.B., W. E. Stewart, and E. N. Lightfoot, Transport Phenomena, p. 42-47, 126-130, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York (1960).
  - For journal articles:
    2. Grafton, R. W., "Losee of brain mass due to excessive reading of student laboratory reports", Chem. Eng. Edu., 18, 457 (1963).
  - For web content:
    3. "Violating the conservation of mass in Unit Operations Experiments", http://www.unitoperations.html
Always include page number(s) when citing books to point the reader to the appropriate section. Note that citations can be handled automatically using a citations manager (e.g. EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley). Style files for AIChE Journal can be found [here](https://endnote.com/style_download/american-institute-of-chemical-engineers-journal/).
- **Member contributions**. Clearly state the contribution of each member to the report.
- **Appendices**. These include:
  - *Data and results*. Tabulate all data collected by the team that is not presented in the report. Add titles and units to make the table readable.
  - *Sample calculations*. Show how you performed each calculation (including error propagation and statistical analysis). Organize in sections by calculation type, with a descriptive title or a brief paragraph between mathematical steps. Work through the calculation step-by-step for a typical case, first symbolically, then with numerical values (making it clear which raw data and/or literature values you are using). Include dimensions of all numerical values and results.
  - *Supplementary Information (optional)*. Items that support your results but are too detailed or lengthy to include in the main body, such as computer code. Organize by sections with descriptive titles. Each section must contain enough explanation to stand on its own.

# Hints

- **Sample calculations**: we encourage you to use either a spreadsheet (or some alternate, such as Jupyter notebooks) for repetitive calculations, but **you must provide a separate step-by-step procedure in detail for each type of calculation**.
  - As a test, ask yourself: "Could someone else easily use my procedures or my data to reproduce my results?" If not, make your sample calculations clearer.
  - Include units with all values and make sure the unit conversions work out.
  - Give full source citations for all literature data, including page number and year of publication.
- **Materials and methods**:
  - Highlight the key aspects of the procedure. What steps are critical in order to get good results?
  - Be specific about quantities used, key dimensions, etc.
- **Equations and background material**:
  - Give a reference unless the equation is common knowledge (such as the Ideal Gas Law) or you derive it.
  - Include the essential background.
- **Nomenclature**:
  - You need to define the variables used in equations in paragraph form after introducing them.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Generalize your results and point out important trends. Do your best to explain anomalies in your results.
  - Do not just speculate: back up your ideas with order-of-magnitude calculations, error propagation analysis, and/or literature values. Address the assignment you were given.
  - Do not just state the results. Interpret them and put them in perspective for the intended audience.

# Spreadsheets

- **Organization**:
  - Keep raw data (actual readings you obtained) separate from things you calculated based on them.
  - Include self-explanatory headings with units.
  - Put the most important worksheets first so they stand out. Use a descriptive label on worksheet tabs.
  - It is possible to overdo this. Too many sheets can be confusing. The basis for all calculations (including error analysis) must be documented in separate sample calculations.
- **Formatting**:
  - Use formatting (shading, borders) to set off raw data from calculated quanitites, to distinguish one "run" from another, etc.
  - Insert comments to provide additional explanation of unusual features. Insert extra text in cells to help the reader understand what you are doing.
  - **Control the number of significant figures displayed**. This is especially important for measured values, but also for calculated results.

# Style and Grammar

- **Tense**:
  - Use past tense to describe things that you did or that happened. For instance: "The measured pressure drop was 2 kPa. Consequently, we decreased the flow rate."
  - Use present tense to describe things that remain true. For instance: "The viscosity of air decreases with increasing temperature." Avoid changing tenses within a paragraph.
- **Person**:
  - Most books on technical writing suggest that you should avoid use of the first person. If in doubt, this is good advice, but the first person, particularly the use of "we", does have a place in technical writing if done in moderation. "We" can make a report seem less stuffy than repeated use of the passive voice. For example, you might say, "WE only studied fully turbulent, incompressible flow..." instead of "This work is restricted to consideration of fully turbulent..." Avoid passive voice sentences that are confusing.
- **Equations**:
  - Write equations on a line separate from the text. Number them consecutively, with the number in parentheses flush with the right hand margin.
  - Define new symbols immediately following each equation. When referring to a particular equation, abbreviate "equation" as "Eq." However, do not abbreviate "Equation" when it is the first word of a sentence.
- **Abbreviations**:
  - Avoid abbreviations where possible.
  - Abbreviate units of measurement only when preceded by a number.
  - The abbreviations of an SI unit should not be followed by a period unless it is the end of a sentence.
  - Abbreviations are usually in lower case letter, but there are exceptions. Exceptions include Chap., Eq., Fig., Hz., pH, A (ampere), K, J (joule), V (volt).
  - Do not use contractions in your report.
  - The standard AIChE symbol for a dimensionless group is an upper case N followed by a subscript. We prefer the practice of most other organizations: an appropriate capital letter and one lower case letter, such as:
    - Reynolds number: Re
    - Prandtl number: Pr
  - **Tables**:
    - Tables should have a title and be numbered in sequence.
    - Place short tables within the text. Long tables should appear on a separate page and should follow the page on which they are mentioned.
    - Give units for all column headings. Footnotes may be included at the bottom of tables.
  - **Figures and graphs**
    - Figures should be computer-generated.
    - Number graphs serially with all other figures.
    - All figures and graphs should have a title. Titles should be descriptive, not merely a statement of the variables appearing on the ordinate and abscissa. Thus "Friction Factor vs. Reynolds Number" is not a good title. A better one might be "Friction Factor for Turbulent Flow in Smooth Tubes."
    - A figure may be embedded in the text or follow the page on which it is first mentioned.
    - Center graphs on a page with adequate margins.
    - Label the axes clearly, show the scale and its units and adjust the scale to facilitate the reading of the data.
    - Experimental points may be small circles, triangles, or other shapes.
    - Use horizontal or vertical error bars to indicate the magnitude of the uncertainty in plots.
    - If the objective is the compare sets of data, either superimpose them on a single graph or use multiple graphs with the same scales for the abscissas and ordinates.
  - **Numbers**:
    - Write small integers (zero to nine) as words (e.g. "three repetitions", not "3 repetitions"). Write all others as numbers, unless they begin a sentence.
    - Exception: write the small integers as numbers when they are followed by a unit of measurement, or when many numbers appear in one paragraph.

# Grading

The FR is graded on 100 points; 80% of the grade goes to the Task Leader and 30% of the grade to each other team member to incentivize teamwork. It is acceptable to "recycle" appropriate parts of the PR in the FR. A sample grade sheet is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h-O_dcOqm0Km5ma1iIPK_Wtypmj2gFeM).

## Oral Presentation

# Requirements

- **The Oral Presentation (OP) Task Leader will be the speaker and is responsible for bringing a laptop loaded with the presentation and ready for plug-in on Oral Day.**
- The OP will be evaluated on the basis of communication and technical results. The grading sheet is provided [here]().
- Plan on a 10 minute presentation.
- Be prepared to answer questions on technical aspects for up to 5 additional minutes.
- **Submit your OP as a ppt file electronically to the designated instructor by midnight on Oral Day.**

# Organization

- **File name**. Use the format "Labx_session_team_experiment_OP". For example, "Lab1_AA_B_PumpCharacteristics_OP".
- Imagine that you are presenting your results to company management and orient your talk accordingly. Here is a typical organization for such a talk:
  1. Briefly state the objectives, summarizing your team's actions, and the main recommendations (which should be repeated at the end).
  2. Orient the audience to the physical content. Give an overview of equipment used, the measurements performed or to be performed, etc. A schematic helps. A photo of the apparatus is rarely effective as an overview, as it includes too much detail. You may use a photo to highlight a specific item, however.
  3. Very briefly discuss the theoretical background. Include only what is essential for clarity.
  4. Focus on the data collected and main results (including uncertainties). This section should convince the audience that you used appropriate procedures, and that your results are credible.
  5. End with strong, specific conclusions and recommendations (supported by the previous discussion). Motivate the audience to take the next step whatever that may be.
  6. It can be helpful to prepare extra slides to deal with questions on technical details.

# Content

- It is better to cover a few key points well than too many points poorly. Do not rush to cover every possible aspect of your project.
- Time your talk to be on the short side so you're confident you will finish on time.
- Avoid getting bogged down in procedural details, equations, etc.
- A little humor is a good way to connect with your audience, but make sure it is appropriate and do not overdo it.
- End with concrete recommendations that are supported by the results.
- Make your ending strong with a call for further action (not "Well, I guess that's all").

# Visual Aids

- Include a title slide that introduces you and your team members.
- Use the appropriate number of slides. Most presenters spend 1-2 minutes per slide. This means that you should have no more than 10-15 slides for a 10-minute talk (not including the title slide). If you show a visual for less than 30 seconds you probably should not include it at all. If it takes more than 2 minutes, it's probably too detailed.


# Delivery

- **Practice**. There is no substitute. Deliver your speech out loud and use a stopwatch to record the length of time your presentation takes. This will help you master awkward phrasing that is essential for proper timing.
- Speak clearly and with volume adequate for listeners at the back of the room.
- Strive for vitality. The enthusiasm you project will be sensed by the audience and will affect their enthusiasm for you and your subject. You should change your pitch, volume, and rate of delivery. Appropriate (brief!) pauses can be helpful.
- Physical aspects of your delivery are also important. You should maintain eye contact with the audience and you should appear to be poised and relaxed. Good posture helps. Some movement helps but fidgeting and pacing should be avoided.
- Do not read your talk! Word-for-word reading is fatal to the spontaneity and enthusiasm.
- Reference to notes or an outline is fine.
- It is almost as bad if you seem to be reciting the whole thing from memory. Memorize the first sentence of two (for a good start), then shift to a more extemporaneous approach.
- Answer questions directly. Do not hedge or ramble.
- If unsure of a question, rephrase it and ask for confirmation before answering (This is a good technique in large rooms when some of the audience may not have heard the question).
- Dress as you usually would for class.

# Grading

- The OR is graded out of 100 points. 60% of the grade goes to the Task Leader; other team members do not collect any points.
- A sample grade sheet is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qZ6SqMlhKvKlwj1yvew26Krd9utOnRFx/view?usp=sharing).
